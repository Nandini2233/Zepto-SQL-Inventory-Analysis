## üßæ Dataset Overview

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**, based on product listings from Zepto‚Äôs app.

Each row is a **unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**, which may belong to the same product but vary by size, weight, or offer ‚Äî mimicking real inventory systems.

| Column                 | Description                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sku_id`               | Unique ID for each SKU                                     |
| `name`                 | Product name                                               |
| `category`             | Product category (e.g. Fruits, Beverages, Snacks)          |
| `mrp`                  | Maximum Retail Price (in ‚Çπ, converted from paise)          |
| `discountPercent`      | Percentage discount applied                                |
| `discountedSellingPrice` | Final selling price post-discount                      |
| `availableQuantity`    | Stock available                                            |
| `weightInGms`          | Weight of the product in grams                             |
| `outOfStock`           | TRUE/FALSE for stock availability                          |
